With Yummy Crummy, parents, as well as children, will be able to track 							their preferences by rating menu items at their restaurant of choice. No longer will parents have to memorize their childrens' taste in							food - Yummy Crummy does all the work!						</p>						<h2> Yummy Crummy </h2>						<p>							The Yummy Crummy application will provide a convenient, user-friendly interface through which users can keep track of which dishes								their family likes and dislikes at different restaurants throughout the area. With each restaurant presenting a different variation of 							classic dishes, it is hard (especially for busy families) to keep track of which family member likes which dish at which restaurant.							In the case of common allergens, it can also be difficult to remember which restaurants includes these allergens. Yummy Crummy								attempts to alleviate these common pains by providing families with an easy, intuitive way to keep track of their food preferences.						</p>					</div>				</div>			</div>		<div id = "footer">		<p> Created by the The Meme Team </br>		&copy;2014 - All Rights Reserved.		</p><br />		</div>	</div></div>	<script src="js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>	 <script src = "js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>	 <script src = "js/bootswatch.js"></script></body></html>
