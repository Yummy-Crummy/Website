With each restaurant presenting a different variation of 								classic dishes, it is hard (especially for busy families) to keep track of which family member likes which dish at which restaurant.								In the case of common allergens, it can also be difficult to remember which restaurants includes these allergens. Yummy Crummy									attempts to alleviate these common pains by providing families with an easy, intuitive way to keep track of their food preferences.								</p>							</div>							<div class = "tab-pane fade" id = "video">								<p>									<a href="http://youtu.be/FpKfAM4Qc64">Video Demo</a>								</p>							</div>							<div class = "tab-pane fade" id = "bios">								<h2>Cassidy</h2>								<p>									<ul>										<li> Senior CS Major with minors in Mathematics and Studio Art</li>										<li> Born in Huntsville, Alabama</li>										<li> Played volleyball for 6 years</li>										<li> Secretary/Treasurer of ACM since Fall 2013</li>										<li> Spine is in the shape of a question mark ?</li>									</ul>								</p>																<h2>Melissa</h2>								<p>									<ul>										<li> Senior Cs Major with a Mathematics minor and STEM path to MBA</li>										<li> Born in Ames, Iowa </li>										<li> Has lived in NYC, Hong Kong, Shen Yang, China, and a hobby farm in East Tennessee</li>										<li> President of ACM since Spring 2014 (retiring to my yacht this winter)</li>										<li> Once planted a garden and accidentally grew a wheelbarrow full of cucumbers</li>									</ul>								</p>																<h2>Nico</h2>								<p>									<ul>										<li> Senior CS Major with minors in Mathematics and the Blount Undergraduate Initiative</li>										<li> Born in Huntsville, Alabama</li>										<li> 9 years of MMA training</li>										<li> 10 years of classical violin training</li>										<li> Doesn't sound any different on helium</li>									</ul>								</p>							</div>						</div>					</div>				</div>			</div>
