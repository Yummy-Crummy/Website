		     	<h1>Project Overview</h1>
			 The Yummy Crummy application will provide a convenient, user-friendly interface through which users can keep track of which dishes	
	   		 their family likes and dislikes at different restaurants throughout the area. With each restaurant presenting a different variation of 
	   		 classic dishes, it is hard (especially for busy families) to keep track of which family member likes which dish at which restaurant.
			 In the case of common allergens, it can also be difficult to remember which restaurants includes these allergens. Yummy Crummy	
			 attempts to alleviate these common pains by providing families with an easy, intuitive way to keep track of their food preferences.
