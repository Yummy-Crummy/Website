		  	<p>
			With so many restaraunt options available, parents have a hard time keeping track of what their picky eaters will and will not eat.
			In such a digital age where nearly everyone has a phone, it only makes sense that there should be a handy app to aid parents in their
			endeavor to keep up with their children's fickle appetites . With Yummy Crummy, parents, as well as children, will be able to track 
			their preferences by rating menu items at their restaurant of choice. No longer will parents have to memorize their childrens' taste in
			food - Yummy Crummy does all the work!
